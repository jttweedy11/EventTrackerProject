# Hunt Tracker

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to lay the ground work for the backend of a hunt tracking application. His application would allow the user to log their daily hunts and their results/notes. The goal is to overtime, allow the user to refine the properties visited relative to their historical success.

### Using the app
A user of the application can search for a hunting experience by ID, or create a new one! The user is also able to delete any previous hunts. Updating existing hunts is currently a work in progress. A user can also view the total acreage of the properties in the system.

### Technologies Used
